Following a previous study [1], we ignored the order of the constituent drugs in each drug combination (i.e., drug A–drug B was considered equivalent to drug B–drug A) and maintained the drug combination sequences of the original databases when constructing the datasets. So the effective size of NCI-ALMANAC dataset is 74139。
